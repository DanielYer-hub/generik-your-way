                This mode was created to add variety to our favorite universe WARHAMMER 40000 in matched play. 
                You can play your games with missions from the GW or any others, with a narrative addition that should 
                bring more realism to your combat zones such as: explode building,<br>
                 minefields, redeployment, 
                EXTERMINATUSS and much more. All you need to do is select your fraction, and press the generic-way button <br>
                and the spirit of the machine will show you the way.<br>
                 And LET THE GALAXY BURN!
